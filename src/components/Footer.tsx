      <p className="page-footer__text">There is a difference between a good engineer and a normal one. I think its important to keep learning and being better.</p>
      <p className="page-footer__text">I’m drawn to early-stage startups because they allow me to be on the frontlines of innovation, driving projects that push boundaries and create real impact. I don’t want to "simply" contribute — I want to be an essential piece. Entire processes, taking bold responsibility for shaping the future of the product and the organization itself. I thrive in environments where fast-paced creativity is the norm, where I can challenge the status quo, break through red tape, and build something from the ground up. I push my teams to think bigger and act faster. Strong teams are the foundations to success.</p>
